moved seializeLibrary.py to comms

imported and used MANAGER_IP from config.py in server.py

altered __init__ in Init_Response class in messages.py to take a string representation of a model as a parameter, and add it to self under the name model, instead of serveral attributes like model, wieghts loss, etc. Also altered response_policy in manager.py accordingly.

altered __init__ in Fetch_Response class in messages.py to take a string representation of model parameters as a parameter, and add it to self under the name weights. Also altered response_policy in manager.py accordingly.

in manager.py, created a keras model designed to solve MNIST

in worker.py, altered initialize_model to actually parse and return a keras model

altered __init__ in Push class in messages.py to take a string representation of model parameters as a parameter, and add it to self under the name weights. Also altered push_weights in worker.py accordingly.

altered response_policy in manager.py to alter the model's weights based on the wieghts in a push message

alered pull_parameters in worker.py to alter its models parameters based on weights in a fetch_response message

imported and formatted training data in worker.py

in both server.py and client.py, removed the import of MANAGER_IP and switched to manually configuring it to the address of my personal computer on my home network. Also changed the call to bind in the run function in Server to bind to (self.manager_ip, self.port) instead of the local variables (host, port).
